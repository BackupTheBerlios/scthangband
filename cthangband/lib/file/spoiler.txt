Although the use of spoilers is not punished within the game, it provides the
player with information which the player might prefer to discover during the
course of the game.

You should also note that the first two items do not give a complete list of
the effects of the items described as certain features are randomised. As these
options only reveal features which are true for every instance of an object,
these features will not be mentioned. As the character information screen does
not indicate the presence or absence of random features, you will not be able
to tell which items may have such features through using this patch alone.
