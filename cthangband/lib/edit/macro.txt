# File: macros.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/macros.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "text file macros" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/macros.raw" file.

# "lib/data/macros.raw" can be safely deleted if ALLOW_TEMPLATES is undefined.

# === Understanding macros.txt ===

# The purpose of this file is to provide a convenient way of replacing
# an arbitrary string in a text file with another arbitrary string.

# Macros are applied to a line in a file in order from the last one to
# the first. This is to enable macros to be defined for macros.txt itself.

# The format of macros.txt is as follows:

# X:name
# Y:definition
# A:definition
# B:definition
# S:keyword
# M:number,number,number,number
# F:file:character:field

# 'X' indicates the beginning of an entry, and gives the name which
# Angband will look for when parsing later parts of this text file,
# or other text files in this directory.

# 'Y' gives a text string which will be substituted for the name wherever
# it is found. This can be empty if it is desired that a string disappear.

# 'A' gives a text string which, if X is found, will be parsed as a line
# after the line in which X is found.

# 'B' gives a text string which, if X is found, will be parsed as a line
# before the line in which X is found.

# 'S' gives the name of a flag which causes a more complex hard-coded
# macro to be run if the name specified is matched.
# The only macro defined at present is "move to front", which causes
# the string matched to be placed at the beginning of the field which
# contains it.

# There must be exactly one "name" and one "definition" in a macro

# If present, 'F' restricts the scope of a macro as follows:

# If there is a file entry, substitutions will only be made in the specified
# file. 

# If there is a character entry, substitutions will only be made in lines
# which begin with the specified character.

# Each line is divided into field. The first field starts at the first
# character, and each successive field starts at successive :s following it.
# E.g. in "::egg:", ":egg" is the second field. In "g::egg:", it is the third.

# If there are multiple 'F' lines, lines in info files which meet any one of
# them are changed by the given macro.

# The 'F' line(s) should generally be at the end of the entry.

# Version stamp (required)

V:1.0.3

# There are several macros which apply to all files used by object_desc().
# To simplify things, these macros create them with a single line.
