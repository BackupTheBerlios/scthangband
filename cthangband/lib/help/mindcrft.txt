Mindcrafting
============

The power of mindcrafting is one of the magical powers available in Cthangband. Mindcrafting involves using your natural energy (called 'Chi') to perform actions.

Although mindcrafting may look at first glance to be one of the simplest forms of magic due to the limited number of powers that can be used, it is not very easy to pick up and only those with a strong mind (a high WIS) will find it worth the effort.

Requirements
============

Mindcrafting is unique amongst the forms of magic in that there is no requirement in the form of material goods or learning. It can be entirely learned by practice and needs no outside help. However, wearing most forms of head covering will interfere with your mindcrafting abilities and reduce the chi that you are able to use effectively.

Usage
=====

You can use mindcrafting powers at any time except when in a shop. Press the '<shift>P' key (control-M in the roguelike keyset) to use a power,  and then select which power to use.  You will be unable to use  mindcrafting powers while confused.

Abilities
=========

Whilst mindcrafting has fewer abilities available to it than most other forms of magic, it makes up for this easily in the increase in power level each ability has when the mindcrafter gets more skilled. The abilities are listed below along with the minimum skill required for use and the chi cost. While it is possible to attempt a mindcrafting ability without having enough chi left, it is not advisable.
