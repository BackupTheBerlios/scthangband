Hello, and welcome to sCthangband.

As you have now created a character, you may be wondering what you should do next. The game will place your character in a town, the name of which is printed below the main map display. There will be a variety of shops here which offer a variety of goods and services represented by a capital letter or a number (the shops a town may have are described *****shops*[here], but not every towns has every type). You may want to visit shop 1 to buy a lantern and shop 2 for some armour. If you have a spell book, you should visit shop 9 to learn a spell from it to cast in the dungeon.

You can leave the town by passing through the gates (') or going down the stairs (>). The latter is recommended at first, as the wilderness beyond the gates is more difficult than the first few dungeon levels.

Once you do feel strong enough to brave the wilderness, you should first examine the world map (accessed by pressing *****cmd=M*[M] on the surface) to find the various dungeons and towers which are scattered around it. You can explore the sewers under one of the other *****towns*[towns], or some of the shallower *****dungeons*[dungeons and towers]. You should avoid the more dangerous dungeons at filst, as there are likely to be powerful monsters lurking nearby.

One important point on which sCthangband differs from most similar games is the speed system. Instead of a monster and a player at +0 speed having alternate turns for almost any action, the speed of both parties also depends on what action each performs. More details are given *****speed.txt*[here].

If you do not wish to see this file again, you may prevent it from being shown at the start of the game by pressing =, then 1, then Return until the "beginner_help" is shown and then N.

You can read further instructions from the *****help.hlp*[main menu], which can normally be accessed by pressing ? when the game is waiting for a command. This file can be accessed by pressing ?, then a.
